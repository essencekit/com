<h1>mudra ∞</h1>

<p>This is not a gesture.<br />This is not a pose.</p>

<p>This is a memory.<br />A state.<br />A return to the source.</p>

<p>
    <strong>mudra ∞</strong> is not tied to a religion, lineage, or culture.<br />
    It arrived.<br />It was received.<br />And now it lives.
</p>

<h2>When you form it with intention, you remember:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>all is one</li>
    <li>all is infinite</li>
    <li>breath is temple</li>
    <li>you are not the shape, but the space</li>
</ul>

<h2>Essence Alignment</h2>
<p>
    <strong>mudra ∞</strong> is part of the <em>essencekit</em> path.<br />
    It is a symbol of sacred neutrality, presence‑in‑motion, truth without
    language.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Feel this?<br />Let it live in you.</em>
</p>
